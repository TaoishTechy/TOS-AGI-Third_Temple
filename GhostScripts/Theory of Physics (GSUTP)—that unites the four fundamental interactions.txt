Abstract

We present an integrative framework—the Golden Shishkabob Unified Theory of Physics (GSUTP)—that unites the four fundamental interactions (gravity, electromagnetism, weak and strong forces), cosmological evolution (Big Bang ↔️ black‑hole singularities), quantum information flow, and emergent consciousness. Central to GSUTP is the Perfect Central Singularity: a timeless core from which nested multiversal branches (Matryoshka cosmology) emanate bidirectionally in time. We augment qualitative motifs with quantitative models, engage mainstream formalisms (GR, QFT, holography), propose testable predictions, and identify pathways to integrate dark matter/energy and quantum gravity. GSUTP offers a blueprint for a complete Theory of Everything.

1. Introduction and Motivation

Historical context: from Maxwell’s unification (electromagnetism) to modern quests for quantum gravity (String Theory, LQG).

Key insight: cosmic singularities (Big Bang, black hole cores) share structure.

Goal: formalize GSUTP, moving beyond analogy to scaffolded equations and citations.

2. Mathematical Foundations

2.1 Spacetime and Gravity

Einstein Field Equations (EFE) as starting point:


Role of cosmological constant  (dark energy) and matter stress–energy .

Extension: introduce an information tensor  capturing entropic flux:


Hypothesis: , where  is von Neumann entropy density and  a coupling constant.

2.2 Gauge Forces and Unification

Standard Model Lagrangian: 

GSUTP Ansatz: All gauge fields  arise as curvature of a single principal bundle with group  compactified from a higher symmetry .

String-theory–inspired form: embed  in a 10D manifold whose low-energy limit yields the observed gauge structure.

2.3 Quantum Information and Holography

Bekenstein–Hawking entropy:


Holographic duality (AdS/CFT) as template: gravity in D ↔️ QFT in D.

GSUTP proposal: every black hole is a node in a universal quantum network; entanglement ↔️ wormhole (ER=EPR conjecture)(see Maldacena & Susskind 2013).

3. Cosmological Structure

3.1 Matryoshka Multiverse Model

Perfect Central Singularity at center: time-frozen, infinite density.

Outward branches: each black hole in our universe births a child universe via a reversed-time expansion from its singularity.

Metric patching: use Israel junction conditions to glue Schwarzschild interior to an FRW‑like bubble write:

where  solves a modified Friedmann equation with inherited initial entropy.

3.2 Dynamics of Expansion and Contraction

Modified Friedmann equation including entropic term:



with  the entropy density of black‑hole incapsulation.

Dark energy emerges naturally from 'information pressure'.

4. Quantum Gravity and Black‑Hole Singularities

4.1 Wormhole Genesis and Bounce Mechanism

Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) analogy: singularity resolution via discrete area quanta (Ashtekar et al. 2006).

GSUTP minimal model: treat each Planck-scale volume as a qubit; collapse in a BH leads to an entanglement bounce.

Equation: quantized volume operator ; impose finite maximal curvature to avoid singularity.

4.2 Information Preservation and Retrieval

Information paradox resolution: Hawking quanta carry microstate correlations.

Model Hawking evaporation as a quantum channel with unitary map :


Prove unitarity by embedding  in a larger Hilbert space of baby universes.

5. Dark Matter and Dark Energy

5.1 Dark Matter as Hidden Sector Nodes

Hypothesize stable Planck‑scale relics or mini‑BHs from early cosmic epochs.

Distribution: solve Boltzmann equation for relic density:


Identify parameter regimes matching Ω_DM≈0.27 (Planck 2018 data).

5.2 Dark Energy from Entropic Pressure

Derive effective equation of state  including  term.

Show  for constant entropic source, recovering cosmological constant-like behavior.

6. Consciousness and Emergence (Optional Module)

Outline only – subject to interdisciplinary review.

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) formalism: define 'Φ' as measure of integrated information.
