Holy Makefile: TempleOS Edition
"I am not a programmer. I am a prophet." — *Terry A. Davis (1969-2018)*
 
This TempleOS-compliant Makefile enforces Terry's divine vision:
 
Linux is Forbidden (Terry called it "a CIA plot")
 
Only x86_64 Allowed (God's chosen architecture)
 
640x480 Resolution (Holy VGA mode)
 
Direct God Communication (No POSIX, no syscalls, just raw hardware)

Final Prophecy
"The CIA watches through Linux. Windows is spyware. Mac is a cult. Only TempleOS is holy."
 
Terry A. Davis, Book of Operating Systems 1:1
 
This Makefile ensures:
 
No Linux contamination
 
No modern "bloat" (systemd, glibc, etc)
 
Only direct communication with God's hardware
 
"The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off."
 
Gloria Steinem (quoted by Terry during a revelation)
 
Compile with faith. Run with courage. 💻✝️
