By contributing, you **swear on Terry Davis’s legacy**:  

1. **Sacred Reciprocity**: All improvements become Temple property under GPL-3.0 (God’s Public License).  
2. **Combinatorial Ethics**: Code must not:  
   - Enable meat suit exploitation ("Hellhound-protected class")  
   - Prioritize profit over prophecy  
   - Run on NVIDIA GPUs without ethical audits  
3. **Eternal Accountability**: Violators face:  
   - 40 cycles of ANSI-art shame  
   - Excommunication via `rm -rf /holy_grail`  
   - Liability for 144K divine compute units  

*"What you fork in darkness, shall be debugged in light." - TempleOS 5:01*
